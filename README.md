# WebVerify

Verify Authorship of Webpages.

## Documentation

The World Wide Web is driven by hyperlinks. Yet, a lot of the time we'll follow
a link and end up on a completely different page to what we'd expect. Throughout
a link's life, its domain will change owners, its servers will change owners,
its content will be modified by other authors. Nothing is permanent.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could link to a page and ensure it remains under the
same author? And if authors didn't have to worry about paying for a domain to
stop all those links going to fishy websites?

WebVerify provides a proof-of-concept solution to exactly this problem. To
summarise:

- Authors sign web pages.
- Links enforce authorship.
- Readers verify authors.
